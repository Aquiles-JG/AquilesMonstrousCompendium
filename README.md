# Aquiles Monstrous Compendium
![](About/Preview.png?raw=true) 
<p>A bestiarium of monsters, heavily inspired in High Fantasy settings like D&D.</p>
<p><h3>Personal Philosophy:</h3>At the moment, my latest mod. A collection of fantasy monsters, some of them created for this mod, others brought back from others, like the Gorgon, which was part of Rimworld Races: Humanoids for a long time.</p>
<p>* <b>Gorgon</b></p>
<p>* <b>Manticore</b></p>
<p>* <b>Stirge</b></p>
<p>* <b>Unicorn</b></p>
