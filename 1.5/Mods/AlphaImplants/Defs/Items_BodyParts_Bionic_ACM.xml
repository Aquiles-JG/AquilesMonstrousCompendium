    <description>An animal petrifying gaze implant. This implant will allow this creature to use a very dangerous petrifying gaze that will slow down its target, and eventually kill it.\n\nNote that installing this on a creature that already has a petrifying attack will have no effect. And obviously a creature will need eyes to use this attack.</description>
